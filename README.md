ðŸ“Š Titanic Survival Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

Description:
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and class distributions using Power BI. Interactive dashboards were designed to analyze relationships between age, gender, class, fare, and survival outcomes.

Key Insights & Features:

ðŸ”¹ Demographics: Breakdown of age groups (Adult vs Child) across male and female passengers.

ðŸ”¹ Class & Fare Analysis: Sum of fares by passenger class with clear visual distributions.

ðŸ”¹ Survival Patterns: Survival rate analyzed by class and gender, showing that women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates.

ðŸ”¹ Family Dynamics: Count of passengers traveling alone vs. with families, along with total family size contribution.

ðŸ”¹ Overall Stats: Survival rate (38%) and average passenger age (~29.6 years).

ðŸ”¹ Visuals Used: Pie charts, bar charts, scatter plots, donut charts, and KPI cards for key metrics.
